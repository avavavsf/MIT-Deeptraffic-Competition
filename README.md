# MIT-Deeptraffic-Competition
Deeptraffic [website](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/)</br>
I will track the speed I achived here.</br>

2017.01.25 I get 72 MPH using only a small input shape.</br>
2017.01.25 with the modified model, I can now get 74.32 MPH.

Since the competition is over, I will not update here.
